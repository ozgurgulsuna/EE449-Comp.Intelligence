\section{\textbf{Basic Concepts}}
\label{main}

Here introduce the paper, and put a nomenclature if necessary, in a box with the same font size as the rest of the paper. The paragraphs continue from here and are only separated by headings, subheadings, images and formulae. The section headings are arranged by numbers, bold and 10 pt. Here follows further instructions for authors.

% \begin{nomenclature}
% \begin{deflist}[A]
% \defitem{A}\defterm{radius of}
% \defitem{B}\defterm{position of}
% \defitem{C}\defterm{further nomenclature continues down the page inside the text box}
% \end{deflist}
% \end{nomenclature}

\subsection{\textbf{Which Function ?}}

An ANNs classifier that is trained with cross-entropy loss approximates the conditional probability distribution function.
More specifically, for an input data, the output of the classifier is a probability distribution for the classes.
The cross-entorpy loss function is a measure between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution.
The form of the loss function is decreasing, smooth and differentiable, which makes it easier to optimize using gradient-based methods.
This form is also known as the negative log-like function.

% An ANNs classifier trained with cross-entropy loss approximates a conditional probability distribution. Specifically, given an input vector, the classifier outputs a probability distribution over the possible classes that the input could belong to. The cross-entropy loss is defined as the negative log-likelihood of the correct class given the input.
% The reason why cross-entropy loss is used to approximate this function is that it is well-suited for optimizing models that output probability distributions. The loss encourages the model to assign a high probability to the correct class and low probabilities to the incorrect classes, which is exactly what we want from a classifier. The negative log-likelihood also has desirable properties such as being continuous and differentiable, making it easier to optimize using gradient-based methods.

% Bulleted lists may be included and should look like this:
% \begin{itemize}[]
% \item First point
% \item Second point
% \item And so on
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{\textbf{Gradient Computation}}
\subsection{\textbf{Some Training Parameters and Basic Parameter Calculations}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The batch refers to a subset of the training data that is used to compute the weights for one iteration. More specifically, the batch size is the number of training samples in a batch.
 The epoch on the other hand refers to the number of times the entire training data is used to update the weights. In training, there are generally multiple epoch iterations where the weights are updated with different batches/subsets of the training data.
    \item For the $N$ number of training samples, the number of batches per epoch is $N/B$, where $B$ is the batch size. A little side note that the solution is rounded up to the higher integer if $N/B$ is not an integer.
    \item For the loss calculation iterations, such as SGD, for $E$ number of epochs, the total number of iterations is $E \times N/B$. Again, a practical side note states that the $N/B$ is rounded up to the higher integer.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{\textbf{Computing Number of Parameters of ANN Classifiers}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Starting from the initial layer of the MLP, we have $D_{in}$ number of input neurons and $H_1$ number of neurons in first hidden layer. Also there are biases associated with 
each neuron. Therefore, the number of parameters of the each layer is,
    \vspace{-0.75cm}
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{r}
    \textrm{Input Layer} = D_{in} \cdotp H_{1} \ +\ H_{1} \\
    \textrm{Hidden Layers}= H_1 \cdot H_2 + H_2\\
    \cdot \cdot \cdot \hspace{2em} \\
    \textrm{More Hidden Layers} = H_{k-1} \cdot H_k + H_k\\
    \textrm{Output Layer} = H_{k} \cdotp D_{out} \ +\ D_{out} \\
    \end{array}
    \end{equation*}

    The total sum can be written as, $D_{in}\cdot H_1 + \sum_{k=2}^{K} (H_{k-1} \cdot H_k + H_k) + H_k \cdot D_{out} +  D_{out}$, where $K$ is the number of hidden layers.
    \item Second point
\end{enumerate}

All tables should be numbered with Arabic numerals. Every table should have a caption. Headings should be placed above tables, left justified. Only horizontal lines should be used within a table, to distinguish the column headings from the body of the table, and immediately above and below the table. Tables must be embedded into the text and not supplied separately. Below is an example which the authors may find useful.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{ An example of a table.}
\begin{tabular*}{\hsize}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lll@{}}
\toprule
An example of a column heading & Column A ({\it{t}}) & Column B ({\it{t}})\\
\colrule
And an entry &   1 &  2\\
And another entry  & 3 &  4\\
And another entry &  5 &  6\\
\botrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}

\subsection{Implementing a Convolutional Layer with NumPy}



References must be listed at the end of the paper. Do not begin them on a new page unless this is absolutely necessary. Authors should ensure that every reference in the text appears in the list of references and vice versa. Indicate references by \cite{Massimo2011} or \cite{Massimo2012} or \cite{Thomas2015} in the text. 

Some examples of how your references should be listed are given at the end of this template in the `References' section, which will allow you to assemble your reference list according to the correct format and font size.

Reference generation by using bibliography style commands for LaTeX template only.

The author may use ``elsarticle-harv.bst'' as per the style required in document. The sample bib file could be referred. 
If the author may using bibstyle for providing references author must comment the bibliography section in TeX file, Bibtex will generate the reference automatically.

If the author may not able to view the references in output same could be done by copying the bibliography section from ``filename.bbl'' file and paste in TeX file.



\subsection{Section headings}
Section headings should be left justified, bold, with the first letter capitalized and numbered consecutively, starting with the Introduction. Sub-section headings should be in capital and lower-case italic letters, numbered 1.1, 1.2, etc,~and left justified, with second~and subsequent lines indented. All headings should have a minimum of two text lines after them before a page or column break.
Ensure the text area is not blank except for the last page.

\subsection{General guidelines for the preparation of your text}
Avoid hyphenation at the end of a line. Symbols denoting vectors and matrices should be indicated in bold type. Scalar variable names should normally be expressed using italics. Weights and measures should be expressed in SI units. All non-standard abbreviations or symbols must be defined when first mentioned, or a glossary provided.

\subsection{File naming and delivery}
Please title your files in this order `procedia acronym\_conference acronym\_authorslastname'.  Submit both the source file and the PDF to the Guest Editor.

Artwork filenames should comply with the syntax ``aabbbbbb.ccc'', where:
\begin{itemize}
\item a = artwork component type
\item b = manuscript reference code
\item c = standard file extension

Component types:
\item gr = figure
\item pl = plate
\item sc = scheme
\item fx = fixed graphic
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Footnotes}
Footnotes should be avoided if possible. Necessary footnotes should be denoted in the text by consecutive superscript letters\footnote{Footnote text.}. The footnotes should be typed single spaced, and in smaller type size (8 pt), at the foot of the page in which they are mentioned, and separated from the main text by a one line space extending at the foot of the column. The `Els-footnote' style is available in the ``TeX Template'' for the text of the footnote.

Please do not change the margins of the template as this can result in the footnote falling outside printing range.


\section{Illustrations}
All figures should be numbered with Arabic numerals (1,2,3,$\,\ldots.$). Every figure should have a caption. All\break photographs, schemas, graphs and diagrams are to be referred to as figures. Line drawings should be good\break quality scans or true electronic output. Low-quality scans are not acceptable. Figures must be embedded into the text and not supplied separately. In MS word input the figures must be properly coded. Preferred format of figures are PNG, JPEG, GIF etc. Lettering and symbols should be clearly defined either in the caption or in a legend provided as part of the figure. Figures should be placed at the top or bottom of a page wherever possible, as close as possible to the first reference to them in the paper. Please ensure that all the figures are of 300 DPI resolutions as this will facilitate good output.

The figure number and caption should be typed below the illustration in 8 pt and left justified [{\bfseries\itshape Note:} one-line captions of length less than column width (or full typesetting width or oblong) centered]. For more guidelines and\break information to help you submit high quality artwork please visit: http://www.elsevier.com/artworkinstructions\break Artwork has no text along the side of it in the main body of the text. However, if two images fit next to each other, these may be placed next to each other to save space. For example, see Fig.~1.
\begin{figure}[t]\vspace*{4pt}
%\centerline{\includegraphics{fx1}\hspace*{5mm}\includegraphics{fx1}}
%\centerline{\includegraphics{gr1}}
\caption{(a) first picture; (b) second picture.}
\end{figure}


\section{Equations}
Equations and formulae should be typed in MathType, and numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in parentheses on the right hand side of the page (if referred to explicitly in the text). They should also be separated from the surrounding text by one space
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\displaystyle X_r &=& \displaystyle\dot{Q}^{''}_{rad}\left/\left(\dot{Q}^{''}_{rad} + \dot{Q}^{''}_{conv}\right)\right.\\[6pt]
\displaystyle \rho &=& \displaystyle\frac{\vec{E}}{J_c(T={\rm const.})\cdot\left(P\cdot\left(\displaystyle\frac{\vec{E}}{E_c}\right)^m+(1-P)\right)}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
