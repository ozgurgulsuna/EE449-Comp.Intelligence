## Fuzzy Systems ##

### Introduction ###

Motivation is to solve problems that are difficult to solve with traditional methods, reason is the linguistic nature of the problem, and the solution is to use fuzzy logic to solve the problem.

**Example** - Sorites Paradox
- a series of grains of sand are dropped one by one on a heap of sand. At some point, the heap will be considered a heap of sand. But if we remove one grain of sand, it will still be considered a heap of sand. This is a paradox.

a methodical way starts with a statement. "n grain of sands are a sand dune." Then the acceptance can be defined as reaching to one as the number of grains are increased.

Any language is discrete and real world is continuous.

The fuzzy logic does not have a precise treshold, but a gradual transition.

#### Membership Functions ####
----

A membership function is a curve that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value (or degree of membership) between 0 and 1.

Terms like **around** are modeled with gaussian or triangular membership functions.

**Linguistic variables** are partitioned in a range with overlapping, non-constant membership functions.
